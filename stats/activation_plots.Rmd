This document creates figures displaying statistical maps for the main contrasts of interest.

Note: requires `reticulate` R package (R interface to python) to be installed.
See [Python Version Configuration](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/versions.html)

Problem is that reticulate with pyenv might require additional steps.
Consider saving into a simple python format (commented regular code / light / percent).

```{python}
import sys
print(sys.version)
```
